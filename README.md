# BayArea_Housing_Project_PreML

## Description
 
This was a group project I worked on with a classmate in my Data Analytics course. The classmate scrubbed the data from Zillow.com and exported it to a csv file.You will find this file within the repository under 'data2.csv'. The jupyter notebook provided in repository was my section of the project.

The project was based on the housing market in the Bay Area on 5 different locations. The goal was to find the significant variable(s) in pricing a house for each city and see how well our statistcal model works.

## Description

After taking Advanced Topics in Analytics I decided to implement what I learned on my original BayArea_Housing_Project. I was able to use the Pytorch to improve my model.
